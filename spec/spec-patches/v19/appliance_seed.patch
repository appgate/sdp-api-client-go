+      When a Controller creates an appliance object it is saved with the current API version. This API version will be used when the seed for that appliance is generated.
+      If the appliance version is now newer than this, the correct API version must be used for the seed.
+      Use latestVersion to override the default API version. The latest API version is shown at the top of this API specification.
